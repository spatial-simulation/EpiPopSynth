# EpiPopSynth

EpiPopSynth v2 is a refactored and modularized population synthesis framework for generating spatially explicit synthetic populations. It extends the original implementation with a unified pipeline design, structured I/O interfaces, and a more efficient optimization backend, while preserving the core modeling assumptions.

The framework is designed to support large-scale spatial simulations and downstream agent-based modeling workflows by providing reproducible, data-driven population generation.
